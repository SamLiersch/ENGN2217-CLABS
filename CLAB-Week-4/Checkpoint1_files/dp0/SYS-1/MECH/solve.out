 This SOLVE command is only used to generate the matrices needed to      
 perform the linear perturbation analysis.  The linear perturbation      
 analysis corresponds to time = 1 (load step = 1, substep = 1).  No      
 results are being written.                                              

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       0.531   TIME= 15:03:23
 The prior(base) analysis is LINEAR, use the total load prescribed in    
 the linear perturbation process to calculate the critical               
 eigen-buckling loads.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
